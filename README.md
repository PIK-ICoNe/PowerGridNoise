# PowerGridNoise

This repo features different data driven models for the dynamics in power systems.
It features: 
- A Data-Driven Model of the Power-Grid Frequency Dynamics [1](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8963682) 
- Data-Driven Load Profiles for Residential Electric Power Consumption [2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.09287.pdf)
- An Intermittent wind power fluctuation Langevin-type model [3](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjb/e2017-80352-8)

# ToDos:
1. Mehrnaz gave me the code for the frequency paper. I should look up the size of the power jumps they used.
2. Enable possibility to use arbitrary number of OU process for the demand curve?
3. Add Mehrnaz Solar Model
